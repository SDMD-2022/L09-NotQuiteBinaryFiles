# Reading and writing data

This is a small app that:

* reads an HTML file from /res/raw and shows the text on the screen;
* contains a converter that stores numbers entered and their conversions to file;
* stores the last number converted to SharedPreferences;
* shows the contents of that file in a list. 

The app makes use of the Bottom Navigation template -- this means fragments are used however these should not detract from the file reading and writing processes.
